		<p>Here is the description of a strategy that moves all computations previously done in the UI thread (in the content and label providers) into background jobs.
			It relies on the SWT.VIRTUAL style for the SWT Tree, that allows using a lazy content provider (ILazyTreeContentProvider).
			Together with a label provider that extends CellLabelProvider, that allows doing asynchronous updates (again, in order to not block the UI thread).</p>
		<p>It works like this: JFace asks for an update (through the content or label provider), that is enqueued on one of the Jobs (round-robin with the number of Jobs equal to the number of available processors).
			Once the information is computed, it is applied on the UI thread (mandatory with SWT).
			These updates are batched in order to minimize the number of switches to the UI thread.</p>
		<p>With this strategy implemented, the browser does not freeze anymore, but it is unfortunately a lot slower on Windows.
			This seems currently unavoidable on Windows (see 
			<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=129457">Bug 129457</a> - Virtual Tree very slow).
