		<p>The goal of the "Java to KDM transformation" discoverer is to get a KDM model from a Java model.
			It is useful when the only available information on a java source code is contained in a Java model. Even without the source code it is then possible to get a KDM representation.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Quality disclaimer: this discoverer is provided without any guarantee: it was only tested on a small number of projects of relatively small sizes. It may not be suitable for production environments.</i>
		</p>
		<h3 id="User_Manual">User Manual</h3>
		<p>A prerequisite is a Java model. Please refer to the 
			<a href="../java_discoverer/user.html"> Java Discoverer</a> user manual.

		</p>
		<p>Once launched, a progress dialog will appear as soon as the operation begins. Depending on the size of your java model, the transformation might take some time to complete:</p>

		</p>
		<p>At the end of the process, the newly created model files are added to the root of your project:</p>

		</p>
		<p>And the model is automatically opened in the default model browser if you selected "Open model in editor after discovery":</p>
