This folder is now deprecated and dead since the migration to Acceleo 4 eliminates the
ability/need to have an XMI version of the *.mtl template.

-------------------------------------------------
See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=553058

The Acceleo builder does not run reliably in the host Eclipse or the Maven build, consequently the
auto-generated /bin/org/eclipse/modisco/jee/jsp/generation/files/GenerateJsp.emtl
cannot be relied upon.  A known good copy is maintained and used from this folder.
