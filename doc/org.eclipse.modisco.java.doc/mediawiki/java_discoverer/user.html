		<h1 id="Java_Discoverer">Java Discoverer</h1>
		<p>The goal of the Java Discoverer plug-in is to allow practical extractions of Java models from Java projects. </p>
		<p>
			<i>Quality disclaimer: this Java Discoverer was tested on projects of varied sizes: see the 
				<a href="java_discoverer_benchmark/user.html">Java discoverer benchmark</a>.
			</i>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Description">Description</h3>
		<p>This plug-in aims at analyzing Java source code compliant with version 3 of "Java Language Specification" from Sun Microsystems and providing a model describing the information found, conforming to the 
			<a href="../java_metamodel/user.html">Java metamodel</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>A Java model contains the full abstract syntax tree of the Java program: each statement such as attribute definition, method invocation or loop is described. In addition, links between elements are resolved (by resolved link we mean for instance a link between a method invocation and the declaration of this method, or between the usage of a variable and its declaration). The model can thus be seen as an abstract syntax graph (ASG). </p>
		<h3 id="User_manual">User manual</h3>
		<p>The plug-in provides the user with a contextual menu to easily create models. </p>
		<p>By right-clicking on a Java Project in the Eclipse Package Explorer view, you can quickly create the Java model of your application (see next Figure). </p>

		</p>
		<p>A discovery parameters dialog opens to let you specify the parameters of the discovery:</p>

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Set 
				<b>SERIALIZE_TARGET</b> to true if you want to save the model to a file
			</li>
			<li>You can define 
				<b>TARGET_URI</b> to the location of a file in your workspace. If it is not defined and SERIALIZE_TARGET is true, a model file will be created in the project.
				<br/>'
				<i>Beware: the file will be overwritten if it already exists!</i>'
			</li>
			<li>You can filter the classes to analyze using regular expressions, by setting INCLUDED_ELEMENTS_REGEX and/or EXCLUDED_ELEMENTS_REGEX</li>
			<li>You can specify additional dependencies (projects or libraries) that you want to analyze and add to the model, by selecting them in the dialog that opens when you click the 
				<b>ELEMENTS_TO_ANALYZE</b> parameter:
			</li>
		</ul>

		</p>
		<p>Once launched, a progress dialog will appear as soon as the operation begins. Depending on the size of your application, the reverse engineering process might take some time to complete:</p>
		<p>
			<img align="middle" title="Progress dialog" alt="Progress dialog" border="1" src="../../img/MoDisco_JavaDiscoverer_ProgressDialog.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>At the end of the process, the newly created model file is added to the root of your project if you set SERIALIZE_TARGET to true:</p>

			<img align="middle" title="Java model in the package explorer" alt="Java model in the package explorer" border="1" src="../../img/MoDisco_Java_Test4javaXMI.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>And the model is opened in the default model browser if you selected 
			<b>Open model in editor after discovery</b>:

		<p>The Java XMI files (with a filename ending in "_java.xmi" by convention) can be opened in any model browser:</p>
